Some notes in regards to Collections:
Arrays / List / Dictionary

Array is fixed size
List is Dynamic
Dictionary is a bag with objects so therefor is much faster

Foreach in c# is readonly, c# doesn't give an access to index!
In order to modify a list (insert or remove) - DO IT BACKWARDS in for loop!

Check out for more methods for List<T> on Microsoft .Net Documentation!
